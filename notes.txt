# Background
I had been musing about making videos of the BOM synoptic charts  for some time.
(I may have started this work elsewhere but here I am, proctrasinating instead of doing housework)
It was prompted by a rude message I got yesterday while innocently opening the BOM radar. It accused me of scraping.
It also directed me to the FTP site:


pdf file is the one to get. It is a svg image, which can provide higher resolutio than the supplied png file.
I have a vague memory of alredy going down this track, but not on the ftp site.
  

 used ImageMagick convert to make the pdf into a png.
But I got an error. Apparently PDF can be hacked so this line was in 
/etc/Imagemagick7/policy.xml
Advice from internet was to comment it out like this:

<!-- <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="gs" /> -->

That worked
